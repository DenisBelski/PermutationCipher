# PermutationCipher
This project implemented a solution for a permutation cipher.
How it works: in the "source text" field, enter the text to be encrypted. 
Then, in the "key" field, enter a sequence of numbers separated by a space (the number corresponds to the character of the source text, starting from 1). 
Next click "Execute" and get the ciphertext in the "processed text" field.

Example:

You can use a short key, then the encryption will look like this:

Similarly, you can decrypt the text using the correct key.
